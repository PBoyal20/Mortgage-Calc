    <p class="text-light">
      The Mortgage Calculator is a simple tool designed to help you estimate your monthly mortgage payments.
      It takes into account the loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and down payment (optional) to calculate
      the monthly mortgage payment. The calculator also provides a breakdown of the payment details, including
      the principal amount, interest paid, total interest over the loan term, and remaining balance.
    </p>
    <p class="text-light">
      By using the Mortgage Calculator, you can get an idea of how much your monthly mortgage payments will be,
      which can assist you in planning your budget and making informed decisions about your home financing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-light">
      Please note that the calculator provides estimates and should not be considered as financial advice.
      The results may vary based on additional factors, such as taxes, insurance, and any applicable fees.
      It's always recommended to consult with a professional financial advisor or mortgage lender for
      accurate and personalized information regarding your specific mortgage situation.
